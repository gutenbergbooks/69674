<p class="right">Pall Mall Gazette, Feb. 21st, 1885.</p>

<p class="cap">Last night at Prince’s Hall, Mr. Whistler made his first
public appearance as a lecturer on Art, and spoke for
more than an hour with really marvellous eloquence on the
absolute uselessness of all lectures of the kind. Mr. Whistler
began his lecture with a very pretty <em>aria</em> on pre-historic history,
describing how in earlier times hunter and warrior would go
forth to chase and foray, while the artist sat at home making
cup and bowl for their service. Rude imitations of nature
they were first, like the gourd bottle, till the sense of beauty
and form developed, and, in all its exquisite proportions, the
first vase was fashioned. Then came a higher civilisation of
Architecture and Arm-chairs, and with exquisite design, and
dainty diaper, the useful things of Life were made lovely: and
the hunter and the warrior lay on the couch when they were
tired, and, when they were thirsty, drank from the bowl, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
never cared to lose the exquisite proportions of the one, or the
delightful ornament of the other: and this attitude of the primitive
anthropophagous Philistine formed the text of the lecture,
and was the attitude which Mr Whistler entreated his audience
to adopt towards Art. Remembering, no doubt, many charming
invitations to wonderful private views, this fashionable
assemblage seemed somewhat aghast, and not a little amused,
at being told that the slightest appearance among a civilized
people of any joy in beautiful things is a grave impertinence
to all painters; but Mr. Whistler was relentless, and with charming
ease, and much grace of manner, explained to the public
that the only thing they should cultivate was ugliness, and that
on their permanent stupidity rested all the hopes of art in the
future.</p>

<p>The scene was in every way delightful; he stood there, a miniature
Mephistopheles mocking the majority! he was like a brilliant
surgeon lecturing to a class composed of subjects destined
ultimately for dissection, and solemnly assuring them how
valuable to science their maladies were and how absolutely
uninteresting the slightest symptoms of health on their part
would be. In fairness to the audience, however, I must say
that they seemed extremely gratified at being rid of the dreadful
responsibility of admiring anything, and nothing could have
exceeded their enthusiasm when they were told by Mr Whistler
that no matter how vulgar their dresses were, or how hideous
their surroundings at home, still it was possible that a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
painter, if there was such a thing, could, by contemplating
them in the twilight, and half closing his eyes, see them under
really picturesque conditions, and produce a picture which they
were not to attempt to understand, much less dare to enjoy.
Then there were some arrows, barbed and brilliant, shot off,
with all the speed and splendour of fireworks at the archaeologists,
who spend their lives in verifying the birth-places of nobodies,
and estimate the value of a work of art by its date or
decay; at the art critics who always treat a picture as if it were
a novel, and try and find out the plot; at dilettanti in general,
and amateurs in particular, and (<i lang="la">O mea culpa!</i>) at dress reformers
most of all. “Did not Velasquez paint crinolines?
What more do you want?”</p>

<p>Having thus made a holocaust of humanity, Mr Whistler
turned to Nature, and in a few minutes convicted her of the
Crystal Palace, Bank Holidays, and a general overcrowding of
detail, both in omnibuses and in landscapes; and then, in a
passage of singular beauty, not unlike one that occurs in
Corot’s letters, spoke of the artistic value of dim dawns and
dusks, when the mean facts of life are lost in evanescent and
exquisite effects, when common things are touched with mystery
and transfigured with beauty: when the warehouses become
as palaces, and the tall chimneys of the factory seem like campaniles
in the silver air.</p>

<p>Finally, after making a strong protest against anybody but
a painter judging of painting, and a pathetic appeal to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
audience not to be lured by the aesthetic movement into having
beautiful things about them, Mr Whistler concluded his lecture
with a pretty passage about Fusiyama on a fan, and made his
bow to an audience which he had succeeded in completely fascinating
by his wit, his brilliant paradoxes, and at times, his
real eloquence. Of course, with regard to the value of beautiful
surroundings I entirely differ from Mr Whistler. An artist is
not an isolated fact, he is the resultant of a certain <i lang="fr">milieu</i> and
a certain entourage, and can no more be born of a nation that
is devoid of any sense of beauty than a fig can grow from a
thorn or a rose blossom from a thistle. That an artist will find
beauty in ugliness, <i lang="fr">le beau dans l’horrible</i>, is now a commonplace
of the schools, the argot of the atelier, but I strongly deny
that charming people should be condemned to live with magenta
ottomans and Albert blue curtains in their rooms in order that
some painter may observe the side lights on the one and the
values of the other. Nor do I accept the dictum that only a
painter is a judge of painting. I say that only an artist is a
judge of art; there is a wide difference. As long as a painter
is a painter merely, he should not be allowed to talk of anything
but mediums and megilp, and on those subjects should
be compelled to hold his tongue; it is only when he becomes
an artist that the secret laws of artistic creation are revealed
to him. For there are not many arts but one art merely:
poem, picture, and Parthenon, sonnet and statue—all are in
their essence the same, and he who knows one, knows all.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
But the poet is the supreme artist, for he is the master of
colour and form, and the real musician besides, and is lord
over all life and all arts; and so to the poet beyond all others
are these mysteries known; to Edgar Allan Poe and to Baudelaire,
not to Benjamin West and Paul Delaroche. However,
I would not enjoy anybody else’s lectures unless in a few points
I disagreed with them, and Mr Whistler’s lecture last night
was, like everything that he does, a masterpiece. Not merely
for its clever satire and amusing jests will it be remembered,
but for the pure and perfect beauty of many of its passages—passages
delivered with an earnestness which seemed to amaze
those who had looked on Mr Whistler as a master of persiflage
merely, and had not known him, as we do, as a master of
painting also. For that he is indeed one of the very greatest
masters of painting, is my opinion. And I may add that in
this opinion Mr Whistler himself entirely concurs.</p>

<p class="cap">MOST VALIANT <em>TRUTH</em>—Among your ruthless exposures
of the shams of to-day, nothing, I confess, have I enjoyed
with keener relish than your late tilt at that arch-imposter
and pest of the period—the all-pervading plagiarist!</p>

<p>I learn, by the way, that in America he may, under the
“Law of ’84,” as it is called, be criminally prosecuted, incarcerated,
and made to pick oakum, as he has hitherto picked
brains—and pockets!</p>

<p>How was it that, in your list of culprits, you omitted that
fattest of offenders—our own Oscar?</p>

<p>His methods are brought again freshly to my mind, by the
indefatigable and tardy Romeike, who sends me newspaper
cuttings of “Herbert Vivian’s Reminiscences,” in which, among
other entertaining anecdotes, is told at length, the Story of
Oscar simulating the becoming pride of author, upon a certain
evening, in the club of the Academy students, and arrogating
to himself the responsibility of the lecture, with which, at his
earnest prayer, I had, in good fellowship, crammed him, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
he might not add deplorable failure to foolish appearance, in
his anomalous position, as art expounder, before his clear-headed
audience.</p>

<p>He went forth, on that occasion, as my St. John—but, forgetting
that humility should be his chief characteristic, and
unable to withstand the unaccustomed respect with which his
utterances were received, he not only trifled with my shoe, but
bolted with the latchet!</p>

<p>Mr. Vivian, in his book, tells us, further on, that lately, in
an article in the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite> on the “Decay of Lying,”
Mr. Wilde has deliberately and incautiously incorporated,
“without a word of comment,” a portion of the well-remembered
letter in which, after admitting his rare appreciation
and amazing memory, I acknowledge that “Oscar has the
courage of the opinions ... of others!”</p>

<p>My recognition of this, his latest proof of open admiration,
I send him in the following little note, which I fancy you may
think <i lang="fr">à propos</i> to publish, as an example to your readers, in
similar circumstances, of noble generosity in sweet reproof,
tempered, as it should be, to the lamb in his condition:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2">“Oscar, you have been down the area again, I see!</p>

<p>“I had forgotten you, and so allowed your hair to grow over the sore
place. And now, while I looked the other way, you have stolen <em>your
own scalp</em>! And potted it in more of your pudding.</p>

<p>“Labby has pointed out that, for the detected plagiarist, there is still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
one way to self-respect (besides hanging himself of course), and that is
for him boldly to declare, ‘Je prends mon bien là ou je le trouve.’</p>

<p>“You, Oscar, can go further, and with fresh effrontery, that will bring
you the envy of all criminal <i lang="fr">confrères</i>, unblushingly boast, ‘Moi, je
prends <i lang="fr">son</i> bien là ou je le trouve!’”</p>

<p class="cap">SIR—I can hardly imagine that the public are in the very
smallest degree interested in the shrill shrieks of “Plagiarism”
that proceed from time to time out of the lips of silly
vanity or incompetent mediocrity.</p>

<p>However, as Mr. James Whistler has had the impertinence
to attack me with both venom and vulgarity in your columns,
I hope you will allow me to state that the assertions contained
in his letters are as deliberately untrue as they are deliberately
offensive.</p>

<p>The definition of a disciple as one who has the courage of
the opinions of his master is really too old even for Mr. Whistler
to be allowed to claim it, and as for borrowing Mr. Whistler’s
ideas about Art, the only thoroughly original ideas I have ever
heard him express have had reference to his own superiority
as a painter over painters greater than himself.</p>

<p>It is a trouble for any gentleman to have to notice the lucubrations
of so ill-bred and ignorant a person as Mr. Whistler,
but your publication of his insolent letter left me no option in
the matter.</p>

<p class="noic">I remain, Sir, faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="right">OSCAR WILDE.</p>

</div>

<p class="right">Truth, Jan. 16, 1890.</p>

<p class="cap">O TRUTH!—Cowed and humiliated, I acknowledge that
our Oscar is at last original. At bay, and sublime in
his agony, he certainly has, for once, borrowed from no living
author, and comes out in his own true colours—as his own
“gentleman.”</p>

<p>How shall I stand against his just anger, and his damning
allegations! for it must be clear to your readers, that, besides
his clean polish, as prettily set forth in his epistle, I, alas! am
but the “ill-bred and ignorant person,” whose “lucubrations”
“it is a trouble” for him “to notice.”</p>

<p>Still will I, desperate as is my condition, point out that though
“impertinent,” “venomous,” and “vulgar,” he claims me as
his “master”—and, in the dock, bases his innocence upon
such relation between us.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
